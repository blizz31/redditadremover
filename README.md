Firefox extension 'Reddit Ad Remover'

Hi Everybody. 

Thanks for checking out Reddit Ad Remover, a Firefox extension to hide obstrusive ads and elements of Reddit which hinder your scrolling experience!

The extension is quite simple. Uses CSS to hide DOM content so is very easily expandable. If you have any features you're dying to add, feel free to branch out and do as you like!

Regards,

Bryce
